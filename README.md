**Version control for database schemas.**

---
Snap is a proof of concept tool to start exploring version control for database schemas. Usually when maintaining and updating database schemas over multiple environments things start to get confusing very quickly. It would also be nice to be able to automate schema updates and rollbacks.

Snap is a tool inspired by [git](http://git-scm.com/) to allow you to manage and interrogate snap managed databases.

Currently only [MySql](http://www.mysql.com/) databases are supported.
